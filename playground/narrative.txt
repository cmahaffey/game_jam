When the monster came up from the bottom of the bed to scare Sophia, he found her crying.

"What's wrong?" the Monster asked.

"I dropped my teddy bear and it tumbled under the bed into the dark."

  //Sophia moves from the bed tile

"No, don't!" the Monster screams.

Sophia disappears under the bed.

  //Sophia disappears.

"You will not survive," the Monster says too late.

The Monster runs after her.

  //The Monster disappears.
